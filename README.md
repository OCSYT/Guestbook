# Guestbook Project
A project made for tech educators industry placement

# Reflection

# Requirements I achieved with this project:
### What did this achieve:
- Form data is validated before database queries are executed to ensure only valid data is available in database
- The CSS is responsive and scales to different screen sizes
- There is working GET/POST routes
- It is fully functional

### What stretch requirements did I achieve
- Users can delete their posts in a session
- I believe my UI has good constrasting colours, spacing and responsiveness and met the 'Good UI' stretch requirement by being visually appealing.
- Form validation is on both frontend and backend to ensure users input correct data
- The guestbook updates in real time

# What was I unable to achieve?
- Nothing this was very easy :>

# What did I find difficult?
- I struggled getting the session ID for the user to stay the same between requests and had to resort to a library to fix my issue (`shouldSendSameSiteNone`)
